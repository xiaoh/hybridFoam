This files in this directory are not compiled locally.  Instead, they
are copied to be together with the OpenFOAM source codes (k-epsilon
models etc.) and complied there.

This is a work-around to avoid mysterious crach. Probably due to some
internal bug of OpenFOAM (1.6). Future version may be free of this
error.
